emptyDir:
This kind of volume will be created when Pod is up. Wenn pod destroyed, of course the volume is removed. One example is emptyDir. Some use cases are to share files or information between container.
An emptyDir volume is first created when a Pod is assigned to a node, and exists as long as that Pod is running on that node. As the name says, the emptyDir volume is initially empty. All containers in the Pod can read and write the same files in the emptyDir volume, though that volume can be mounted at the same or different paths in each container. When a Pod is removed from a node for any reason, the data in the emptyDir is deleted permanently.

Note: A container crashing does not remove a Pod from a node. The data in an emptyDir volume is safe across container crashes.
On node where POD was assigned, this directory will be used for shared volume
/var/lib/kubelet/<pod-uid>/volumes
