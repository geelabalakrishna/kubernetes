In Kubernetes, resource quotas are used to limit and monitor the amount of compute resources (such as CPU and memory) that can be consumed by objects within a namespace. 
They provide a way to control and allocate resources among different applications or teams running in the cluster.
Resource quotas are defined at the namespace level and can be created using Kubernetes manifests or through the command-line interface (kubectl).
